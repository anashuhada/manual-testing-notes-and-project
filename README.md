This GitHub repository is created as part of my learning journey to become a software tester. The goal of this project is to document and enhance my skills as a software tester by creating a comprehensive manual testing guide. Using the open-source OpenCart platform, I developed and managed the following:

1) Test Scenarios: Defined the high-level scenarios to be tested.

2) Test Cases: Created detailed test cases based on the test scenarios.

3) Test Execution: Executed the test cases and record the results.

4) Bug/Defect Report: Identifed and reported any defects or issues found during testing.

5) Test Summary Report: Summarized the testing process, results, and any issues encountered.

6) Notes: Included additional observations and learning points throughout the project.

This project helped me develop my manual testing skills, understand testing processes in a real-world application, and enhance my ability to document and report on testing activities. The work shared on GitHub to demonstrate my learning and progress.
